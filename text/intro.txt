Hello everyone, my name is Sarthak Kumar. I am a final-year Computer Science student and a passionate Machine Learning Engineer. I live with my family, who have always supported my journey and encouraged me to keep learning and exploring new technologies.
One thing I truly enjoy is working on AI, Machine Learning, and full-stack development projects—especially building real-world solutions like Campus Connect AI, Content Moderation System, and AI-Powered Emergency Response System. These projects allow me to apply my skills and create meaningful impact.
A fun fact about me is that I often talk to myself while thinking through complex problems—it's my way of brainstorming ideas. Something people usually don’t know about me is that I can sit for hours debugging code until I find the perfect solution.
My favorite domain is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, because it allows me to innovate, explore data, understand real-world patterns, and build systems that improve people’s lives.
Thank you for listening.
